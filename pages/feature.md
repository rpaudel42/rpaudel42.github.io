In any application domain where the data are represents an entities and the relationship between
entities, e.g., web-page and hyperlinks; people and their friendship; papers and citations;
network devices and traffic flow; chemical compound and their bond, the graph is usually massive.
If a data have $$n$$ entities, it is essentially an $$O(n^2)$$ dimensional object.
Graph being ubiquitous standard for representing such relational data, impose a sheer challenge
to any learning algorithm because of it's size. In this work, we investigate a graph representation
 technique that will project high-dimensional graph data into a fixed-size feature vector
 that preserve the good approximations of the original properties of the graph.
 We further, demonstrate the usefulness of such representation technique in both static and
 streaming graph and show how it can be used by standard machine learning process.

The proposed approach first performs a fixed-length random walk in a graph to construct *n-shingle* from a walk path.
It then identify top $$d-$$discriminative *n-shingle* using entropy measure.
Finally, sketching is done for each graph $$G$$ where a $d-$dimensional sketch vector ($ S_d $)
is generated by enumerating the frequency and a walk cost of each discriminative shingles
obtained from a graph $$G$$. The use of a shingle-based approach to representing the graph
helps to capture both their local graph structure and an edge order.
In addition, the proposed approach for sketching preserve the good approximations of the
original properties of the graph (for example, the graph proximity is well-preserved)
in such a $ d- $ dimensional space because if two graphs share a common structure,
they share a higher number of *n-shingle* therefore their *sketch* $ S_d $ are
mapped close. The sketch vector $ S_d $ can be processed by any standard machine
learning algorithm for detecting the DoS attack.
