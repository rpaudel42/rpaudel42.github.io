Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to fraud in the U.S. health care system. Health care claims are com- plex as they involve multiple parties including service providers, insurance subscribers, and insurance carri- ers. Medicare is susceptible to fraud because of this complexity. To build a comprehensive fraud detection system, one must take into consideration all of the fi- nancial practices involved among the associated parties. This paper is focused on graph-based analysis of CMS provided Medicare claims data to look for anomalies in the relationships and transactions among patients, ser- vice providers, claims, physicians, diagnosis, and pro- cedures. In our experiments, we create graphs from in- patient, outpatient, and carrier claims data of the benefi- ciary. We then demonstrate the potential effectiveness of applying graph-based anomaly detection to the problem of discovering anomalies and potential fraud scenarios.
