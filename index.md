Ramesh Paudel is an PhD Candidate in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu)
at the Tennessee Technological University;
research in concept drift in graph stream; graph based anomaly detection; smart homes. His PhD advisor is
[William (Bill) Eberle](http://users.csc.tntech.edu/~weberle/).

Ramesh received a MS in [Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu)
in 2014, from the Tennessee Tech. University&ndash;Cookeville. He
worked as a software developer in [Bespoke House Inc.](http://bespoke.house), Boston, MA from 2014-2016. In 2016, he re-joined
[Tennessee Tech](https://www.tntech.edu) to do his PhD.

His primary research focuses on solving real world problems using graphs like [Anomaly Detection of Elderly Patient Activities in Smart Homes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramesh_Paudel4/publication/325296524_Anomaly_Detection_of_Elderly_Patient_Activities_in_Smart_Homes_using_a_Graph-Based_Approach/links/5b154ee84585151f91f96b49/Anomaly-Detection-of-Elderly-Patient-Activities-in-Smart-Homes-using-a-Graph-Based-Approach.pdf), and [Anomalous Activity Detection in Diabetic Patients](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramesh_Paudel4/publication/319333465_Detection_of_Anomalous_Activity_in_Diabetic_Patients_Using_Graph-Based_Approach/links/59a59526a6fdcc61fcf97b98/Detection-of-Anomalous-Activity-in-Diabetic-Patients-Using-Graph-Based-Approach.pdf).
Recently he has been focusing on the development of unsupervised concept drift detection approach in graph streams.
