Ramesh Paudel is a Doctoral Candidate at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu), Tennessee Tech University. His Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. William (Bill) Eberle](http://users.csc.tntech.edu/~weberle/).
Ramesh's principal research interest is in concept drift detection on graph stream and graph-based anomaly detection usually in the field of health care, smart homes, social networks, etc.

His research is motivated by real-world problems that can be mapped into graphs. Some of his notable works in the field of fraud/anomaly detection involve [Spam Detection in Twitter Trending Topics]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/spamtweet.html), [Network Layer DoS Attack Detection]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/dosattack.html), [Anomaly Detection in Individual Activities in Smart Homes]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/smarthomes.html) and [Anomalous Activity Detection in Medicare Claim File]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/medicare.html). In particular, my research focuses on designing effective and scalable algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection on drifting graph streams. The developed methods will be applied to detect concept drift using the unsupervised approach, predict future drift and incorporate the drift information to design an online graph-based anomaly detection algorithm for effective anomaly detection.

He received an MS degree in [Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu)
in 2014, from Tennessee Tech University, Cookeville. From 2014-2016, he worked as a software developer at [Bespoke House Inc.](http://bespoke.house) Boston, MA. In 2016, he re-joined [Tennessee Tech.](https://www.tntech.edu) for Ph.D. and continued his research.
