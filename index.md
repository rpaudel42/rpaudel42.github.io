  <h3>About </h3>
</div>
<br />
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu) at Tennessee Tech University. My PhD advisor is [Dr. William (Bill) Eberle](http://users.csc.tntech.edu/~weberle/).
My principal research interest is in concept drift detection on graph stream and graph-based anomaly detection usually in the field of health care, smart homes, social networks etc. 

My research is motivated by real-world problems that can be mapped into graphs like [Anomaly Detection of Elderly Patient Activities in Smart Homes](https://csce.ucmss.com/cr/books/2018/LFS/CSREA2018/ICD8019.pdf) and [Anomalous Activity Detection in Diabetic Patients](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS17/paper/view/15455/14978). In particular, my research focuses on designing effective and scalable algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection on drifting graph stream. The developed methods will be applied to detect concept drift using the unsupervised approach, predict future drift and incorporate the drift information to design online graph-based anomaly detection algorithm for effective anomaly detection. 

I received an MS degree in [Computer Science](http://www.csc.tntech.edu)
in 2014, from Tennessee Tech University, Cookeville. From 2014-2016, I worked as a software developer at [Bespoke House Inc.](http://bespoke.house) Boston, MA. In 2016, I re-joined [Tennessee Tech.](https://www.tntech.edu) for Ph.D. and continued my research.
